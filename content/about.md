Hi, I am Chinmay Shah, a 21-year-old Computer Science senior who is quite optimistic about the future and strongly believes we can make the world a better place.

I usually blog on Medium, and you can find me active on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/chinmayshah899). 

I am software developer by heart but love both software dev and data science (but I would confess I prefer building frameworks >> models).

I am not inclined to any specific language or frameworks, take up whatever language that is best for the project. But lately, I've been mostly working with Python, but do have strong foundations in C++ and JS among others. 

I have a couple of projects spread across various domains, more about it [here](/projects).


I am super excited about Multi-planet civilization, Quantum Computing and AI among other stuff. But I believe AI won't take over the world but definitely we will need to reskill our-selves. 
A strong believer in if you want to change the world, you gotta do it yourself. If you wait for others, probably it'll be too late.

I like to read (mostly blogs and non-fiction), bike, code and like to play keyboard too.
At the end, all I gotta say is if you are the same person as a month before, you aren't learning enough and probably you need to challenge yourself a bit more. 

Want to talk further? Hit me up on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/chinmayshah899) or [Contact here](/contact).


Thanks for reading!
